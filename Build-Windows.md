# Build instructions for Windows

As of ParaView version 5.9.1 we no longer build plugins for Windows. Please see our latest
supported release for ParaView version 5.1.2 . Checkout that tag of the source code or an earlier one 
if you want to build for another version of ParaView.

The source code contains many plugin examples.

The wiki used to be the official resources but it is being phased out.
